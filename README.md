This project is developed using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and written in the C/C++ programming language. It forms the basis of a smart home automation system, leveraging Arduino hardware and sensors to automate household tasks based on environmental cues such as motion, gas leak, light levels, and distance.

Compoents Used here:
1. Arduino Uno
2. Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
3. PIR Motion Sensor
4. Gas Sensor
5. 16*2 LCD Display
6. Photoresistor
7. Relay SPDT
8. Resistors
9. DC Power Source
